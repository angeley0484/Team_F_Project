### Proposal Project - Modular Grid-Based Card Game: Implementing Program Modularity


# Final Project - Modular Grid-Based Card Game: Implementing Program Modularity



## Description

-Project Description:
To solve a serious lack of card games in people's lives, and to advance our knowledge of computer modularity and project scale, we want to build a card game based on triple triad within the unreal engine.

-Problem Diagnosis:
For our project, we want to build a card game that will solve and further our ability to program modular systems within programs. As program modularity scales, it is to make smaller modular systems that scale and can be reused and adapted as the size of the project grows to scale, making the project overall easier to work with. 

-Proposed Solution:
As with every software engineering program, there are a few difficulties, but they will all be overcome by teamwork and copious amounts of debugging. The main difficulties are learning the game engine, in this case, the unreal engine,  creating the foundation for the card game, a 3x3 grid based on the already established triple triad game that we plan to use as a base, and making the cards in such a way that they only interact with cards that they are touching and cards that are of lower power or in other words, lower number.

-Plan of Work:
a)Tools: We plan to use the Git and Unreal engines as the main tools for this project. Our main project files will be established through gits and modified within the game engine unreal before being committed to a master branch to ensure rapid iteration and a solid foundation where all members can contribute equally and still be able to work on specific tasks as needed. We will also employ outside programs like Photoshop for art, Blender for any outside 3d modeling needed, and Vscode or any other code editor to create bug-free testable code, as needed. Finally, the language that we plan to use is C++, a bit of Python and if we decide to upload the game to a website, we will be using HTML, CSS, and potentially React.
